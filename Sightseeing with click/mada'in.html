<p> Mada'in Saleh, formerly known as Al-Hijr City, is an archaeological site located in the Hejaz region of the Arabian Peninsula, northwest of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, specifically in the Al-Ula Governorate of the Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah region.  The place occupies a strategic position on the road linking the south of the Arabian Peninsula with Mesopotamia, the Levant and Egypt. The place has its historical fame, which it derives from its location on the ancient trade route linking southern Arabia and the Levant</p>
